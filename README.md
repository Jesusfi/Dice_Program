# Dice_Program

You will be given the code for a file called Dice.java, Study the class and take note of the methods 

      -	rollDice – will generate a random number between 1 -6 
      -	getCurrentSide – will return the value of the currentSide 


Create a file called DiceGame, this is where you will write the main method and the code for this program
To win the game, the user needs to keep rolling until he/she reaches a score of 20. However, if the user rolls a 1 they will lose 
The game should stop when the user loses or decides not to roll again

    -	Create the Dice object 
    -	Create a variable of score of type int
    -	Ask the user if they want to roll
    
          o	If they say yes, roll the dice 
          o	Then check to see if they rolled a 1 
          o	If they did, print out that they lost
          o	If they did not, print out what they rolled, and the score 
          o	Then check the score, if the score is greater or equal to 20 print out that they won
          
    -	If the user said no print out goodbye 
    -	Finally wrap the code in a loop so that it will keep repeating
    -	Test it and submit to GitHub
